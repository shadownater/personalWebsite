We made The Wolf, a point-and-click horror game in which the player has been kidnapped by the Wolf and needs to escape before the Wolf comes and gets you!<p>This was a lot of fun to work on, but we did not finish it in the 72 hours of Ludum Dare. We spent more time on it and completed it afterwards. It was our first time using Gamemaker and we made all our own art. Overall, it was a very fun project to work on and I plan on taking part in another Ludum Dare in the future!MULTIPLE MEDIUMS",
