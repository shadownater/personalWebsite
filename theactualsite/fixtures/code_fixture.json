As a team of six, we made a site where users could sign up, make posts, comment, and add their friends. I personally worked on most of the user posting aspects of the site, allowing users to upload images and utilize markdown while protecting against code injection. This was the first time I used Django and I learned a lot of web development, HTTP, and teamwork in the process.",

I tried out fixtures for the first time on this site as a means of quickly loading project/art information all in one spot, then utilizing Django's templates to make it look nice for me. This is also the first time I have used Bootstrap and I've learned a lot about using grids, containers, carousels, and more. It was a lot of fun to make!",

We made The Wolf, a point-and-click horror game in which the player has been kidnapped by the Wolf and needs to escape before the Wolf comes and gets you! This was a lot of fun to work on, but we did not finish in the 72 hours of Ludum Dare. We spent more time on it and completed it afterwards. It was our first time using Gamemaker and we learned a lot making this game. We also learned how to edit sounds in Audicity and, because we wanted a surreal art style, we created artwork in ways we had not considered before (ie, using pizza as a texture for a plant). Overall, it was a very fun project to work on and I plan on taking part in another Ludum Dare in the future!",
