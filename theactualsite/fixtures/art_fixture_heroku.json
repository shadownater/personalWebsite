Overall, I wish the colours didn't turn out so dark in this picture, but it was an interesting experiment.",

Sorry it's got a gross watermark. They took much longer to make than I'd planned but life has been happening and that's ok, I'll get it done when I can! I might come back to fix Todoroki at some point, something is off about him.",
