                        I'm an artist programmer, programming artist!
                        <br><br>I'm a graduate from the University of Alberta with a degree in Specialization
                        in Computing Science and a certificate in game development. I enjoy creating things, so I
                            initially thought I would be completing a bachelor of Arts at my local college.
                            My first year doing that wasn't very satisfying, so I switched into the
                        sciences. I craved the problem-solving I used to do in my math classes, but I still wanted to be
                        creative in my field. Computing science was the best option, and it has allowed me to combine
                        my interests in the best way possible. I enjoy learning new things, and computing science has
                            a lot to learn about.
                        <br><br>I can code in Typescript, Swift, Java, C, Python, Javascript, Html, CSS, and Sass.
                            I think my favourite is Java, but lately I've been using Typescript and Python.
                            I also know SQL and I prefer to use SQLite.
                            I have experience making games with Gamemaker and a little bit of Unity experience as well.
                            Mostly I've functioned as the artist for teams making games, but I enjoy the opportunity to program them as well.
                            I am often the only artist in a room of programmers, so I will fill the role where I'm most needed.
                            My sister and I participated in a gamejam in the summer of 2017 and it was a very cool experience!
                            I would like to do more of them in the future.
                        <br><br>I made this website in Django, and I used Bootstrap for the first time for the layout.
                            Please see my coding tab for more information.
                        <br><br>As for art, I mostly work digitally in Krita. I love Illustrator and Photoshop is pretty great too.
                            I used to work as a graphic designer for a few summers between my studies. I personally like to draw my own
                            characters or characters from anime/games. Besides digital/traditional artwork, I make costumes as a hobby.
                        <br><br>Thank you for visiting!
